        <h2>pig dice game rules</h2>
        <p>The game consits of two players.</p>
        <p>On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. <br>The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die.<br> However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated <br> during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score <br> from previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll.</p>
        <p>A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not <br>want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points <br> from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled <br> during that turn are added to his or her score.</p>
        <p>When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, <br> the game ends and that player is the winner.</p>
